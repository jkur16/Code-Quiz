# Code-Quiz

## Description
The purpose of this assignment was to create a timer-based coding assessment using vanilla JavaScript that behaves like so:

The application has a few multiple choice questions and the ability to store top scores on the user's device. You get 90 seconds to complete the quiz but will be penelized 10 seconds if you fail to answer a question correctly. You will receive 100 points for each correct answer. 

At the end of the quiz (when the user answers all questions or time is up), upon viewing their score, the user is able to enter their initials to add their score to the High Scores list.
